### Old codes  	

*  `lhe_reader.py`: 
	- Read the LHE generated by madgraph. it creates a csv with the final invariant mass for the processes generated with four final leptons.
	- Ubuntu: /mnt/d/projects/PhD/WorkArea/codes. 
	- running in my_root_env
	- [x] Instal the pylhe library in Windows conda

* `events_invariant_mass_plot.py`:
	- It plots the histograms with the csv files generated with  `lhe_reader.py`.
	- Windows: D:\projects\PhD\BLSSM\codes

## New codes

The  [[compute_processes.py]] computes the three processes with four final leptons in [[2015. W. Abdallah. S. Khalil. S. Moretti]]. It can be executed in the WSL 2 in:
- /mnt/c/Users/jmaur/Dropbox/obsidian/PhD/BLSSM/codes

- [x]  Add the four loop to run all three processes
- [x]  Add the final $\gamma \gamma$ processes 
- [x]  Add to this folder both Old codes to have everithing organized.
